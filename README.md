# Yawn â€” a Rust UI framework that just does things differently :)

It's inspired by Jetpack Compose and is currently a pain in the butt to implement...

## Runtime

Yawn Runtime is like Jetpack Compose Runtime, a library that lets you manage a tree of `Node`s and use them to do
anything.

## UI

Yawn UI is planned to use Skia (yes, we're going all-copy) to render sh@tty pixels to some losers' screens
