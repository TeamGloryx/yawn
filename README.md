# Yawn â€” a Rust UI framework that just does things differently :)

It's inspired by [Jetpack Compose](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core/tree/jb-main/compose)
and is currently *just a rewrite* of it in Rust.

## Runtime
Yawn Runtime is like Jetpack Compose Runtime, a library that lets you manage a tree of `Node`s and use them to do
anything.

## UI
Yawn UI is planned to use Skia to render pixels to some screens, not excluding phones' screens.

### Jetpack Compose
Huge credits to the creators of Compose, not only for the work they've done, \
but for inspiring a lot of people, for example, me, \
to create tools for it, or sometimes **full frameworks** (like this one! ðŸ™‚), inspired by it.
